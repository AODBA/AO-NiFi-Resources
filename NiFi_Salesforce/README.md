# Salesforce data management with Apache NiFi


Apache NiFi is using the Salesforce Rest Api to do:

- Salesforce monitoring 
- Salesforce data extraction
- Salesforce schema extraction 
- Salesforce Sandbox creation
- Salesforce TraceLogs Setup and Purge Cycle
- Etc...  

Flow will get really complicated, but also really interesting 


# Note 
I am a Data Engineer so i look a interacting with Salesforce using my data engineer approach, there will people asking why i don`t use apex and other tools .... 
I choose NiFi.
